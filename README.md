### Denial of Service (DoS)
- The network can be flooded.
- The connection between two computers can be disrupted.
- The services of specific systems or even a person can be attacked.
- An individual can be prevented from accessing their service.


### What Countermeasures Should Be Taken Against DoS Attacks? 
- Install patches.
- Disable unneeded or unused network services. This will limit your exposure.
- Use quota systems for your operation systems.
- Establish baselines for acceptable activity and then use it to gauge unusual levels of activity that may signal an attack.
- Invest in fault-tolerant and redundant network configurations.

### Eavesdropping
When most people think of eavesdropping, they imagine someone around the corner, listening to a conversation. Well, something very similar can happen over the Internet. Sometimes, it’s quite literal.

Note:
For example, a local network using a HUB sends communications to every port, as non-recipients simply drop it. A “sniffer” can be used to grab all of that incoming data, which is now free to browse for the hacker.

### What Countermeasures Should Be Taken Against Eavesdropping?
- Encryption is the most important solution here. Only use applications and systems that have strong encryption applications
- NAC (network access control) and physical security are wise investments. Both of these will help prevent unauthorized users from getting on your network.

### Impersonating/Masquerading
- Most common examples of masquerade attacks are perpetrated with the use of stolen passwords or other login credentials.
- These types of attacks often happen because employees are being lazy.
- Phishing can be the source.

Note: 
Usually, it’s by finding gaps in programs or a way around the network’s authentication process.


### What Countermeasures Should Be Taken Against Masquerading?
- One very common approach against this form of attack is to use innovative algorithms to detect suspicious actions on your network.
- Suspicious emails should not be opened.

---
### Replay Attacks
- Replay attacks get this name because they’re carried out by a hacker who essentially replays an authentication session to trick a computer into granting them access. Any retransmission of network data transmissions for the sake of unauthorized access to a system would fall under this type of attack
- What’s really scary about this kind of attack is that it can be done even when encryption is used. The hacker doesn’t actually need to know the contents of the message. They just have to resend it in many cases.


### What Countermeasures Should Be Taken Against Replay Attacks?
If encryption can’t save you, what possible countermeasures can you take against replay attacks?
--
- One option is an anti-replay protocol that leverages packet sequence numbers.
- The destination keeps a “sliding window” record of the numbers used so far by validated packets it’s received.
